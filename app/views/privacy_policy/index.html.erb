        <p class="py-4">The Services may use both cookies that we implement and cookies implemented by our suppliers and other third parties. “First-party” cookies allow your browser to talk to the actual website that you are visiting, whereas “third-party” cookies allow your browser to talk to third-party websites, such as the source of an ad that appears on the website you are visiting or a third-party analytics provider. Our suppliers may use cookies and tracking technologies to track Service users across the Internet to understand how you get to the Services and for the analytics purposes disclosed in this privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies and this privacy policy does not cover the use of third-party cookies.

        <p class="py-4">A cookie can either be a “session” cookie or a “persistent” cookie. Session cookies exist only for so long as you are visiting the applicable website. Session cookies are typically deleted or removed when you exit or quit your browser application. Persistent cookies exist for a set period of time, for example, six (6) months or one (1) year. Each time you visit a website that has implemented a persistent cookie, that cookie will remain active until its predetermined expiration date. You can also manually delete persistent cookies as discussed above.</p>
        <p class="py-4">The types of information collected by a cookie and the purposes for which that information is used depends on the type of cookie. By way of illustration, the types of cookies used, the types of information collected by those cookies, and the purposes for which that information are used are described below. We may combine information collected by cookies with other collected information.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Operationally necessary cookies (also called essential cookies).</i> These are cookies that are required for the operation of the Services. For example, these cookies are required to identify irregular website behavior, prevent fraudulent activity, and improve security. They also allow users of the Services to make use of its functions. Without these cookies, features and services you have requested will not be able to be provided.</li>
          <li><i>Functional cookies.</i> These cookies allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using the Services. This may include to remembering choices you make, for example, remembering your preferences or settings, remembering if you reacted to something on or through the Services so that you are not asked to react to it again, remembering if you have used any feature of the Services before, and enabling social media components. If functional cookies are disabled, various functions of the Services may be unavailable to you or may not work the way you want them to.</li>
          <li><i>Performance cookies (also called analytical cookies).</i> These cookies assess the performance of the Services, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how visitors use and interact with the Services, for example, which pages on our websites users visit most often. These cookies also enable us to personalize content and remember your preferences. These cookies help us improve the way our websites work and provide a better, personalized user experience.</li>
          <li><i>Advertising or targeted cookies.</i> These cookies record your visits to the Services, the pages you visit on our websites, and the links you have clicked. They gather information about your browsing habits and remember that you have visited a particular website. Company and its third-party advertising platforms or networks may use this information to make the Services and its content more relevant to your interests (this is sometimes called “behavioral” or “targeted” advertising and is further discussed above). These cookies are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.

        <p class="py-4">Most browsers automatically accept cookies. Browsers generally also allow users to manage cookies in the browser’s settings. For example, a browser may allow you to reject cookies from certain websites, reject certain types of cookies regardless of the website, reject or disable all cookies from all websites, and/or delete previously stored cookies. Some browsers also give you the option of being notified every time a cookie is sent to your browser by a website. You can disable or limit cookies but doing so may impact your use and enjoyment of the Services and other websites. For example, the Services may not be able to be personalized for you, may no longer capture or remember your preferences or other choices you have made on the Services in the past, and may not remember your name or contact information or other information you have entered using the Services, and our website may not recognize the device(s) you use to access the Services.</p>
        <p class="py-4">Changing your cookie preferences in one browser will not necessarily carry over to other browsers, so you may need to adjust your preferences each time you get a new device, install a new browser, upgrade an existing browser, or alter or delete a browser’s cookie file.</p>
        <p class="py-4">The Services may also use the following types of tracking technologies: web beacons (also called clear GIFs), flash cookies, and pixels (also called pixel tags). Web beacons are tiny graphics with unique identifiers that function similar to how cookies function but, in contrast to cookies, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites. Flash cookies collect and store information about your use of a website and are commonly used for advertisements and videos. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove and cannot be used to manage Flash cookies. Click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank" class="underline text-sky-500">here</a> for information on how to manage Flash cookies. Pixel tags can be placed on websites or within emails to track your interactions with those websites and when emails are opened.</p>
        <p class="py-4"><strong>Analytics: </strong>The Services use third-party analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) to collect and process data about your use of the Services, including when you visit the Services, URLs of the websites that you visit prior to visiting the Services and when you visit those websites, and IP addresses assigned to the devices from where you access the Internet. Our analytics providers may set and read cookies to collect this data and your web browser will automatically send data collected by those cookies to our analytics providers. Our analytics providers use this data to provide us with reports that we will use to improve the Services’ structure and content.</p>

        <p class="py-4"><strong>Advertising Networks, Personalized Advertising, Remarketing, and Retargeting: </strong>From time to time the Services may use or participate in advertising networks and related advertising services that are managed and provided by third-party advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors, and research firms, including Google Ads and advertising services provided by Meta (sometimes referred to the Meta “tracking pixel”).</p>
        <p class="py-4">These services collect information about your visits to and interactions with the Services and other websites and will use that information to target advertisements for goods and services and to display those advertisements on other websites. The information collected may be associated with your personal information.</p>
        <p class="py-4">Advertising networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumer’s interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer’s specific interests. This practice is often referred to as “online behavioral advertising.” For example, a third-party advertising network might collect the type of web browser you use, the type of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or not you visit specific pages of the Services and other websites, the location of your Internet service provider, the date and time of a visit to a website, and other interactions between you and a website.</p>
        <p class="py-4">To opt out of remarketing advertising provided through Google, to customize your ad preferences, or to limit Google’s collection or use this information, visit <a href="https://www.google.com/safetycenter/tools" target="_blank" class="underline text-sky-500">Google’s Safety Center</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" class="underline text-sky-500">Google’s Ad Settings</a> and follow <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7048998" target="_blank" class="underline text-sky-500">Google’s personalized ad opt-out instructions</a>. Opting out will not affect your use of the Service.</p>
        <p class="py-4">If you have a Meta account but do not wish for Meta to collect data relating to you via the Services, we suggest that you take the steps outlined below under “Social Media.”</p>
        <p class="py-4"><strong>To change your preferences with respect to certain online ads and to obtain more information about third-party ad networks and online behavioral advertising, please visit the </strong><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="_blank" class="underline text-sky-500"><strong>National Advertising Initiative Consumer opt-out page</strong></a><strong> or the </strong><a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank" class="underline text-sky-500"><strong>Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Program</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Please remember that changing your settings with individual web browsers or ad networks will not necessarily carry over to other browsers or ad networks. As a result, depending on the opt-outs you request, you may still see our ads from time to time. Your device may also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for behavioral advertising purposes.</p>
        <p class="py-4"><strong>Social Media: </strong>The Services may implement widgets, tools, or applications provided by social media platforms and the Services may otherwise allow for interaction, integration, or content sharing with third-party social media platforms and companies. We may be required to implement cookies, plug-ins, and APIs provided by those social media platforms in order to facilitate those communications and features. By choosing to use any third-party social media platform or choosing to share content or communications with any social media platform, you allow us to share information with the designated social media platform. Interactions, integrations, and content sharing with a social media platforms and their features may require or allow the social media company to collect information from or about you, whether through cookies, registration information, or otherwise. Social media companies may track your online activity even when you do not choose to interact with the social media platform or its widgets or other features. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any social media platform that you use or visit in connection with the Services, as those platforms’ respective privacy policies will govern their collection, use, and disclosure of information they collect from you. We cannot control any policies or terms of such third party platform. As a result, we cannot be responsible for any use or disclosure of your information or content by third-party platforms, which you use at your own risk.</p>
        <p class="py-4">The Services may also use the advertising services and networks offered by social media platforms to deliver advertising content. Use of these services requires social media platforms to implement cookies or pixel tags to deliver ads to you while you are logged into the applicable social media platform.</p>
        <p class="py-4">If you do not want social media platforms to collect information relating to you via the Services or to link information collected via the Services to your social media accounts, we suggest that you: (a) do not connect to or share information with social media platforms using the Services; (b) hide social media platform plug-ins using an ad blocker; (c) always log off completely from social media platforms before visiting the Services or other websites and delete all related cookies; and, (d) where the option is made available by a social media platform, disable the advertising services and networks operated by that platform. For example, you may opt out of X’s (formerly Twitter) interest-based advertising by notifying Twitter through one of the methods it describes <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170405" target="_blank" class="underline text-sky-500">here</a>. You hereby acknowledge that Company makes no guarantee that exercising the foregoing options is guaranteed to prevent applicable social media platforms from tracking you and, further, you acknowledge that Company is not responsible for a social media platform’s tracking of you.</p>
        <p class="py-4"><strong>Our Social Media Pages: </strong>Company is active on social media. You may have the opportunity to comment on social media platforms regarding, as well as send us reviews and testimonials regarding, Company and the products and services we offer and/or to submit or upload related photos and other materials.

        <p class="py-4">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

        <p class="py-4">However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.

        <p class="py-4">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
